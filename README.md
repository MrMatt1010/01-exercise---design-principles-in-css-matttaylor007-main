## Instructions - Improve the visual design

Apply your [web design](https://github.com/Developers-Institute/WDD01-Intro-Client-Side-Web-Development/tree/master/Topics/CSS/Design) and CSS knowledge to improve the design of the plain HTML website.

- Fix the HTML heading hierarchy and ensure your website is accesible by running a [Lighthouse Accesibility Report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvn2XCmNKXI), and ensuring you receive a score of `100`. 
- Use relative units for your font sizes (`rem` NOT `px`)
- Use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for your design
- Center your website content. See [an example of centering a website on Codepen](https://codepen.io/lwcooper/pen/YzVzrjw)

**Acceptance criteria**

- The web page uses design principles that make the page easier to read. For example white space, proximity, visual hierarchy
- The page content is centered.
- The page scores 100 in the [Lighthouse Accesibility Report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvn2XCmNKXI) - any existing errors are fixed
- The `rem` CSS Unit is used for `font-size`, `margin` and `padding`
